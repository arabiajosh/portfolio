Sampled Programming Work: Josh Arabia

Last Updated: 20 September 2019

## Welcome

Hello, and welcome to the repository. My name is Joshua Arabia, and this portfolio highlights some of the programming projects I've undertaken recently. In way of introduction, I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Computer Science. The main emphasis of my studies is data science and machine learning, mainly in the area of computer vision. Most of my personal work involves distributed systems and real-time augmented reality modelling.

This portfolio represents some of the work that I've been involved in over the past months and years. Recently, I've been fortunate enough to work with the University's own Vibrant Media Lab in developing a number of applications ranging from distributed weather tracking systems to historical game restoration.

I hope that you will find the contents of this portfolio both interesting and informative of the kind of work I produce. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me at <josh.arabia@pitt.edu>.

## Contents

The contents of this portfolio are sorted by language used, and represent some of the projects I've worked on most recently in those languages. Inside, you will find:

  - Source code for a portable, [Arduino based weather station](c++/Arduino-Weather-Station) (`C++`), created in association with the University of Pittsburgh's own Vibrant Media Lab. Also included are unit tests for the proof of concept of the project's second iteration.
  
  - A functional character by character [autocomplete application](java/) (`Java`), that tracks user preferences and suggests the words you use most frequently. This can be run with `java ac_test` from the java directory.

  - A CLI tool for performing [Association Rule Mining](python) (`Python`). The tool is one part of a larger pipeline to process and analyze transaction data.

  - Source code for an open source Magnavox Odyssey game called [Tanhauser Gate](c++/Tanhauser-Gate) (`C++`). Created as part of the OdysseyNow project, it is a simple AI game master for the world's first home gaming console.
